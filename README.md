This File contains a project that is based on a price prediction model.
The products here are masked and many other variables like age, occupation, and marital status are used. A basic Exploratory Data Analysis is performed and correlation is derived with machine learning algorithms like linear regression and XGBoost.
The use of both algorithms was done to achieve good accuracy, the first algorithm used here was linear regression with least R-squared value as 0.16 to counter this XGBoost was used.
